This is a repo for scraping, parsing and automatically reconciling ministerial and non-ministerial transparency spending data above Â£25k at the granularized payment level. For some background reading on the data origination and provenance, [please see this document](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/662332/guidance_for_publishing_spend.pdf). It aggregates and cleans thousands of files (mostly csv, xls and xlsx) for consistency and quality controls the files in various ways. The files are predominantly hosted on gov.uk and data.gov.uk, although some are hosted on departmental homepages and require more specialised functions. An axillary function matches the supplier field via the [OpenCorporates REST API](https://api.opencorporates.com/documentation/API-Reference) (bypassing Open Refine). It then links *any* positive matches found with the (Companies House Api)[https://developer.companieshouse.gov.uk/api/docs/index.html] and builds in a range of supplementary data on the matched company. The spending data involved is made available under an [Open Government License](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/). The [OpenCorporates reconciliations](https://opencorporates.com) for company names are made available under an [ODbl License](https://opencorporates.com/info/licence). [Companies House data](http://business.data.gov.uk/companies/docs/about-this-service.html) is supplied under section 47 and 50 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 and Schedule 1 of the Database Regulations (SI 1997/3032). You'll need a Companies House API key which should be stored in src/ch_apikey (or use the ```noreconcile``` option described below).

#### Install and Run

The only requirement is an installation of Python 3, and the only dependancy is unidecode (```pip install unidecode```). To run: [download a zip](https://github.com/crahal/centgovspend/archive/master.zip) of this repository or `git clone github.com/crahal/centgovspend/`. All that's then required is running

```python centgovspend.py [options]```

 at the command line. For debugging, a logfile can be found at logging/centgovspend.log.

#### Options

There are a range of options (all optional) to include in the execution of the above command, mostly aimed at reducing repetition on repeat runs or focusing on specific datasets:

* `depttype=ministerial`   : only scrape/parse ministerial depts

* `depttype=nonministerial` : only scrape/parse nonministerial depts

* `depttype=both`           : default

* `cleanrun`                : delete all subdirectories before running (default = off)
* `noscrape`                : dont scrape any new data (incompatabile with cleanrun, default off)

* `noopencorporates`        : dont match and merge with the packaged opencorporates database (default = do it)

* `noreconcile`        : don't reconcile via opencorporates and companieshouse (default = do it)

#### Reconciliations

The file ```clean_matches.py``` provides a fuction for post-processing of the matches. The first option ( ```type == 'automated_safe'```) automatically accepts any match which has a score greater than 70 and which does not have a second highest match score within 10 points of it.  The second option (```type == 'manual_verification'```) automatically rejects all matches below a score of 20, accepts all above 70, and asks for manual verification of those inbetween.
